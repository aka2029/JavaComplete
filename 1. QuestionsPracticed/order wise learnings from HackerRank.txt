1. got into the basics of "Scanner"
	
	Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
String myString = scanner.next();
int myInt = scanner.nextInt();
scanner.close();

System.out.println("myString is: " + myString);
System.out.println("myInt is: " + myInt);

--> This is the way to use scanner.

2. While using scanner if we want to skip something then use .skip()
	EG. if i want to input a line of string instead of a single tokken
	then do as given
	
	Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        int i = scan.nextInt();
        double d = scan.nextDouble();
        scan.skip("(\r\n|[\n\r\u2028\u2029\u0085])?");
        String s = scan.nextLine();

--> Here, for having the input of complete line use scan.nextLine() instead
of scan.next() but scan.nextLine() will also take the \n after the previous 
input so to skip this we use "scan.skip(--this is a regex expression--)"

3. Then in "https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/java-output-formatting/problem"
challenge, we learnt about formating in java using printf()

The best link to refer is "https://www.baeldung.com/java-printstream-printf"

4. learning the use of printf() api in java is very important.

5. To find power of a number eg. 2^3 = 8 use "import java.lang.Math;"
int power = (int)Math.pow(2,3); //power = 8

6. Learn how to use MIN_VALUE and MAX_VALUE function in datatypes 
(https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/java-datatypes/editorial) question
while refering to their range.
